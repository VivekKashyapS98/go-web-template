#GO-WEB-TEMPLATE

This is a web template (GraphQL) which includes authentication & authorization code to get started.

You can use this as your starter code. MongoDB Atlas is used here. So, you will have to create a `.env.local` file as add your MongoDB URI in there as `MONGO_URI=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. Please name it as `MONGO_URI` as the Go code refers to the URI using the same name.

Hope it helps. Cheers.. ;)
